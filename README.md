## General information
    In this repository, I have implemented and compared several supervised machine learning algorithms for various 
    classification and regression tasks. The algorithms implemented in this repository include but are not limited 
    to Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), 
    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks.

    For each algorithm, I have provided a detailed implementation and evaluation of its performance. Additionally, 
    I have also included comparisons of the algorithms performance using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, 
    precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve.

    This GitHub repository is implemented in both Python and R. For the Python implementation, I have used popular 
    libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to implement and evaluate the various supervised 
    learning algorithms. For the R implementation, I have used libraries such as caret, tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2, and 
    randomForest.
    Both implementations provide a comprehensive set of scripts that cover different machine learning tasks such as 
    binary and multiclass classification, regression, and hyperparameter tuning.

- **Breast cancer dataset**: This dataset contains information about breast cancer tumors, including features such as 
tumor size, texture, and severity, along with a binary label indicating whether the tumor is malignant or benign.
