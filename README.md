## General information

In this repository, I have implemented and compared several supervised machine learning algorithms for various 
classification and regression tasks. The algorithms implemented in this repository include but are not limited 
to Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), 
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks.

For each algorithm, I have provided a detailed implementation and evaluation of its performance. Additionally, 
I have also included comparisons of the algorithms performance using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, 
precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve.

This GitHub repository is implemented in both Python and R. For the Python implementation, I have used popular 
libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to implement and evaluate the various supervised 
learning algorithms. For the R implementation, I have used libraries such as caret, tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2, and 
randomForest.
Both implementations provide a comprehensive set of scripts that cover different machine learning tasks such as 
binary and multiclass classification, regression, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Datasets

- **Breast cancer dataset:** This dataset contains information about breast cancer tumors, including features such as 
tumor size, texture, and severity, along with a binary label indicating whether the tumor is malignant or benign.
- **Fashion-MNIST dataset:** This dataset is similar to the popular MNIST dataset but instead of containing images of 
handwritten digits, it contains images of 10 different types of clothing items such as t-shirts, dresses, shoes, and 
bags. The images are grayscale and have a resolution of 28x28 pixels.
